Python\\xa02.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python\\xa02.[35]\\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[36][37][38][39]\\nHistory\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s[40] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[41] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December\\xa01989.[42] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker.[43] In January\\xa02019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[44][45]\\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[46] Python\\xa03.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python\\xa02.6.x[47] and 2.7.x. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[116] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[117]\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[118][119]\\nProgramming examples\\nHello world program:\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:\\nLibraries\\nPython\\'s large standard library[120] provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.[197] OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.[198]\\nPython is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, and scikit-learn.[199][200][201][202] As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[203]\\nPython can also be used for graphical user interface (GUI) by using libraries like Tkinter.[204][205]\\nPython can also be used to create games, with libraries such as Pygame, which can make 2D games.\\n This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[76]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\" and \"bar\".[77][78]\\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style.'}, {'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-python/', 'content': 'Prerequisites:\\nKnowledge of any programming language can be a plus.\\nReason for increasing popularity\\nLANGUAGE FEATURES\\nPython vs JAVA\\nPython\\nJava\\nDynamically Typed\\nStatically Typed\\nThe classical Hello World program illustrating the relative verbosity of a Java Program and Python Program\\nJava Code\\nPython Code\\nSimilarity with Java\\nLOOK and FEEL of the Python\\nGUI\\nCommand Line interface\\nSoftwares making use of Python\\nPython has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language.\\n Data Structures and Algorithms\\nML & Data Science\\nWeb Development\\nLanguages\\nInterview Corner\\nCS Subjects\\nJobs\\nPractice\\nContests\\nIntroduction To Python\\nPython is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
